# This project uses in-memory storage and doesn't require a .env file.
# The environment variables are already configured in docker-compose.yml
# This file is included as a template for projects that DO need environment configuration.
# 
# For real projects, you would add:
# - Database credentials (never commit actual .env file!)
# - API keys
# - Secret tokens
# - External service URLs
